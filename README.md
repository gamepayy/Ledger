# GamePayy Ledger

This ledger is a work in progress. It is not yet ready for production.

## Overview

This ledger is the backend system that manages GamePayy's platform balances and transactions. It utilizes MYSQl as the database through PlanetScale. It is written in Go and utilizes the [Gin](https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin) framework to handle HTTP requests and build the documentation. It utilizes Redis for caching.
It exposes a REST API for the GamePayy platform to interact with.
