## Onboarding process
### Requirements
| Requirement | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Game demo | A demo of the game |
| Game token | A deployed token |
| Game website | An official website for the game |
| Game description | A short description of the game |
| Game logo | A logo for the game |
| Game contract | The game contract address and github repository for the contract |
| Intent letter | A letter of intent to join the program |
| KYC | Know your customer information |


The program will provide:
- An API key to fully integrate the game with the Gamepayy platform
- A game page on the Gamepayy website
- Documentation and tutorials
- Full support from the Gamepayy development team

Onboarding rules:
- Games can only register a token they own
- Games can only register ERC20/ERC721/ERC1155, but no native tokens (ETH, BNB, Matic).
- API keys for demos are freely given, but a demo key only supports up to 10 completed challenges and the tokens are listed at the demo field (so no scammer has an easy time deploying to our platform)
- A token address can only be registered once. Disputes can be opened via tickets.
- Upon approval to the api keys, we require a deposit of the equivalent of 50k usd worth of tokens
- Game owners must sign an agreement putting us at no responsibility in regards to their game tokenomics health 
- We collect a higher percentage of fees in comparison to mainnet tokens.
- We reserve the right to do whatever we want with the tokens - option to lock tokens through payment
This brings us the need to develop an SDK for easy developer onboarding, a lot of instructive documentation, Youtube tutorials and ofc a reliable system
